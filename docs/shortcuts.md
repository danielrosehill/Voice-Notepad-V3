# Keyboard Shortcuts

## In-App Shortcuts

These shortcuts work when the Voice Notepad window is focused.

### Recording

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+R` | Start recording |
| `Ctrl+Space` | Pause/Resume recording |
| `Ctrl+Return` | Stop and transcribe |

### Text Actions

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+S` | Save to file |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Copy to clipboard |
| `Ctrl+N` | New note (clear current) |

## Global Hotkeys

Global hotkeys work **system-wide**, even when Voice Notepad is minimized or unfocused. Configure them in **Settings > Hotkeys**.

### Default Configuration

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| F14 | Start recording |
| F15 | Stop recording (discard) |
| F16 | Stop & transcribe |

### Recommended Keys

**F14-F20 (macro keys)** are recommended because they:

- Don't conflict with standard application shortcuts
- Are easy to bind to physical macro keys
- Work consistently across applications

### Supported Keys

- **Function keys**: F1-F20
- **Modifiers**: Ctrl+, Alt+, Shift+, Super+ (combinations)
- **Media keys**: On supported keyboards

### Setting Up Hotkeys

1. Open **Settings** (toolbar button)
2. Go to the **Hotkeys** tab
3. Click the key field for the action you want to configure
4. Press your desired key or key combination
5. Click **Save**

### Notes

- On Wayland, global hotkeys work via XWayland compatibility
- Some key combinations may be captured by your desktop environment
- Test hotkeys after configuration to ensure they work as expected
