## Tips for Better Transcriptions

### Speaking Style

- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- The AI handles natural speech patterns well
- You can include verbal instructions like "delete that last sentence" or "new paragraph"

### Recording Quality

- Use a decent microphone (USB mics work well)
- Minimize background noise
- Position the microphone appropriately

### Cleanup Prompt

The default cleanup prompt works well for most use cases. It:

- Removes filler words (um, uh, like)
- Adds punctuation and paragraph breaks
- Follows verbal instructions
- Formats output as markdown

For specialized content (code, technical terms, etc.), consider customizing the prompt in Settings.
