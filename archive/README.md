# Archive Folder

This folder contains code, features, or documentation that has been temporarily removed from the main codebase but may be useful in the future.

## Structure

- `parked-code/` - Code snippets that have been removed but might be reused later

## Guidelines

When archiving code:
1. Include the original file path and line numbers
2. Add the date it was removed
3. Explain why it was removed
4. Describe what it does and how to re-enable it

This helps future maintainers understand the context and easily restore features if needed.
